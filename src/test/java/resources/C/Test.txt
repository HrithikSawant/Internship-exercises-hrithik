Be it a good time or bad time, it waits for none, just like the tide does not wait for anyone.
Also, if time stops, it will disturb the whole functioning of the world, so the way it passes is necessary too.
Imagine, sunset stopping for a while, or if the moon stays for long, everything will get disturbed, so time should pass also and all we can do is make the best use of it.
We cannot make any moment stop or wait for us, so, all we can do is to make the best use of it.
If we do not utilize time, we will lament our past once it is gone.
Only regret and guilt stays once you waste time, and one can do nothing about it once it is gone.
Each phase or each time has its importance like childhood and teenage are different, but both are special and should be lived to the fullest; anyway, they will be once gone too.
When we are happy, we feel like stopping that moment but time waits for none, and that is why even in bad times we should think that this will go away too.
Once the time is gone, no power will get that back to you, so we should be cautious while spending time.
Success depends on how much importance we give to every moment and how effectively we utilize time
